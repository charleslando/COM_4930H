## Project Proposal
This project involves three main objectives:
1. **Reimplementing an Existing Deep Learning Project:** Utilize Jax to reimplement an existing deep learning project, including datasets and segmentation tasks. This will demonstrate Jax's capabilities in handling complex machine learning workflows.

2. **Neuron Contribution Analysis:** Identify which neurons contribute to the classification for each class. This involves exploring techniques in neural network interpretability to understand the decision-making process of the model.  

3. **Model Customization and Retraining:** Customize models that need to be retrained for new tasks using Penzai. This will involve adapting existing models to new datasets and tasks, showcasing the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning models built with Jax.
